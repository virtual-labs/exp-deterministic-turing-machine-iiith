### Aim of the experiment

The concept of a turing machine is usually perceived to be difficult to understand by students, possibly due to the involved mathematical definition. A virtual experiment has the benefit of clearly showing the running of a turing machine on a string written on a tape. Depending on the final state of the ‘head’ and the configuration of the tape, the learner can infer whether the
given string is accepted by the given turing machine.
